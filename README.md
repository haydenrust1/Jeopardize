This is a full stack web application and the game is based on the famous game of Jeopard! We got the idea when one of our team members found a 
JSON file with every question ever asked on Jeopard. We couldn't resist the oppurtunity to make a web app game that the user could play at home. 
This is a great game to play alone or with the whole family!

To play the game the user must first create a login. Once logged in the application will take you to the gameboard that looks similar to a Jeopardy
style gameboard. It will then populate the categories and the answers based on the dollar amount of the answers, remember you have to ask the 
questions! (What is...? Who is? Where is...?)
